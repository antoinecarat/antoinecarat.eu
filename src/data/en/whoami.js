      'IT became one of my passions while I was studying electronics in high-school. I started to learn how to code to better unserstand how things work under the hood. Easy-learner, I spend a part of my free time searching for new languages or frameworks to learn. I recently developped a real appeal to web and cloud relative technologies which led me to do several internship around Openstack and AWS solutions and also to spend time learning JS based frameworks like React or VueJS or about languages like Go or GraphQL.',
