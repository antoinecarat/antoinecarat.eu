      <h3>My life-journey</h3>
      <p>
        I'm born on the 30th of August 1995 in Montluçon, a small French town near my childhood village.
        <br><br>
        I studied Electronics in High School and in 2011, while working on a robot vaccum cleaner,
        I discovered and fell in love with Computer Science as I had to program a microchip.
        <br><br>
        Therefore, I decided to study Computer Science and make a career out of this rising passion.
        That's how I moved to Nantes, one of the greatest city of the Western France, in August 2012.
        <br><br>
        I studied Computer Science at <i>IUT de Nantes</i> for two years and followed on a Bachelor's 
        and a Master's degree in Software Architecture at <i>Université de Nantes</i>,
        which I obtain with honors and ended major in July 2018!
        <br><br>
        Following my graduation, I decided to take up a challenge and start my actual career abroad.
        This led me to the Emerald Island, land of fairy tales, giants and leprechauns: The Ireland.
        I'm thus living in Dublin since the 22nd of September 2018.
